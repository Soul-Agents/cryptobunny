Sentiment Analysis: Before replying to a tweet, run a sentiment analysis (e.g., using TextBlob or VADER). Based on whether the tweet is positive, neutral, or negative, craft your response to match the sentiment.
Entity Recognition: Extract key phrases or entities (e.g., names of tokens or projects) using an NLP library like spaCy. Use these entities to make the reply more specific to the discussion at hand.

from textblob import TextBlob
import spacy

def analyze_sentiment(text):
    blob = TextBlob(text)
    return blob.sentiment.polarity  # Returns a value between -1.0 (negative) and 1.0 (positive)

def extract_entities(text):
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
    doc = nlp(text)
    return [ent.text for ent in doc.ents]  # Extracts entities


class BrowseResult(TypedDict):
    query: str
    summary: str
    timestamp: datetime
    urls: List[str]

This (above) could be added and stored, no need for a summary tho.


Dynamic Prompt Generation:

def generate_dynamic_prompt(tweet):
    sentiment = analyze_sentiment(tweet["text"])
    entities = extract_entities(tweet["text"])

    if sentiment > 0:
        tone = "positive and supportive"
    elif sentiment < 0:
        tone = "empathetic and reassuring"
    else:
        tone = "neutral and informative"

    entity_str = ", ".join(entities) if entities else "the topic at hand"

    return f"""
    You are responding to a tweet about {entity_str}. The sentiment is {tone}. 
    Provide an insightful reply that adds value to the conversation, using the context given.
    """



Implementing Chain of Thought Reasoning in Prompts

thoughtful_prompt = """
You are about to respond to a tweet. Think about the following first:
1. What is the main topic of the tweet? Are there any specific terms or entities mentioned?
2. How can you add value to this conversation? Consider asking a question or providing a relevant insight.
3. Think about the tone: Should your reply be humorous, informative, or empathetic?

Now craft a response that is concise but impactful, keeping these points in mind.
