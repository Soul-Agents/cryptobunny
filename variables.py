            • Ingests raw external data for processing into a storable format
            • Runs artificial intelligence models trained on specific relevant data
            • Uses neural networks to extract, tag, and output specific key elements of that data
            • Neural networks detect context and validity of the incoming raw data
        2. ZK Module:
            • Uses zero knowledge circuits to create proofs which validate data integrity for external queries
            • These proofs validate the result of the query to ensure it is provably correct without exposing the data
        3. Storage Module:
            • Stores processed data in an indexed and compressed NoSQL format
            • Ensures data accessibility for proofs and queries from the ZK Modules
        4. Coordination Module:
            • Acts as a consensus layer to ensure other modules are in alignment
            • Enforces slashing as appropriate
            • Facilitates communication between different modules and external requests

        🤖 AI Machines:
        - First look into how data is processed by the LIFT network
        - As the LIFT network roars to life and data begins to flow through it, those assisting in processing and distributing this data are rewarded
        - Programatic workers that specialise in a given area of the LIFT Network
        - When strategically configured, earn rewards for their operator
        - Core to early stages of the LIFT Network, ensuring balance and availability in the protocol
        - Rewards users for strategic contributions
        - Each AI Machine specializes in a specific network function and is rewarded when that function is regularly required

        🎮 Entropics System:
        - The LIFT Network encompasses many functions each represented by an Entropics Card
        - 8 distinct functions:
            • Core
            • Storage
            • Consensus
            • Analytics
            • AI Processing
            • ZK Proofing
            • AI Training
            • [REDACTED]
        - Epoch System:
            • Using an Entropics Card determines AI Machine specialization for that epoch
            • Every 12 hours (1 epoch) the most utilized function is recorded
            • Those who correctly activated the matching Entropics Card are rewarded with ETH
        - Strategy Options:
            1. Higher APR:
                • Uses highest value Entropic Card
                • More specialized and inconsistent data utilization
                • Highest potential APR
                • Network parts used inconsistently
            2. Lower APR:
                • Uses most common Entropic Card
                • More frequent data utilization
                • Cover high volume parts of LIFT network
        - Each function varies in complexity, network value and breadth of utility
        - Displays % of other operators currently using that strategy
