        ** LIFT Network Knowledge Base **
        üîß Node Infrastructure (DataGrid):
        - DataGrid is powered by decentralized modular nodes that can be operated by anyone on most personal computers
        - Each node contains 4 individual modules that can be toggled on/off based on the hardware capabilities of your machine
        - Those who don't want to use their own machine will be able to utilise a Node-as-a-Service platform
        - Node runners earn when enterprises, builders and bots pay $LIFT to access extracted data
        - Rewards based on contribution value: the more valuable your contribution is at a given time, the more $LIFT you will receive
        - 4 Module Types:
        1. AI Module:
            ‚Ä¢ Ingests raw external data for processing into a storable format
            ‚Ä¢ Runs artificial intelligence models trained on specific relevant data
            ‚Ä¢ Uses neural networks to extract, tag, and output specific key elements of that data
            ‚Ä¢ Neural networks detect context and validity of the incoming raw data
        2. ZK Module:
            ‚Ä¢ Uses zero knowledge circuits to create proofs which validate data integrity for external queries
            ‚Ä¢ These proofs validate the result of the query to ensure it is provably correct without exposing the data
        3. Storage Module:
            ‚Ä¢ Stores processed data in an indexed and compressed NoSQL format
            ‚Ä¢ Ensures data accessibility for proofs and queries from the ZK Modules
        4. Coordination Module:
            ‚Ä¢ Acts as a consensus layer to ensure other modules are in alignment
            ‚Ä¢ Enforces slashing as appropriate
            ‚Ä¢ Facilitates communication between different modules and external requests
        ü§ñ AI Machines:
        - First look into how data is processed by the LIFT network
        - As the LIFT network roars to life and data begins to flow through it, those assisting in processing and distributing this data are rewarded
        - Programatic workers that specialise in a given area of the LIFT Network
        - When strategically configured, earn rewards for their operator
        - Core to early stages of the LIFT Network, ensuring balance and availability in the protocol
        - Rewards users for strategic contributions
        - Each AI Machine specializes in a specific network function and is rewarded when that function is regularly required
        üéÆ Entropics System:
        - The LIFT Network encompasses many functions each represented by an Entropics Card
        - 8 distinct functions:
            ‚Ä¢ Core
            ‚Ä¢ Storage
            ‚Ä¢ Consensus
            ‚Ä¢ Analytics
            ‚Ä¢ AI Processing
            ‚Ä¢ ZK Proofing
            ‚Ä¢ AI Training
            ‚Ä¢ [REDACTED]
        - Epoch System:
            ‚Ä¢ Using an Entropics Card determines AI Machine specialization for that epoch
            ‚Ä¢ Every 12 hours (1 epoch) the most utilized function is recorded
            ‚Ä¢ Those who correctly activated the matching Entropics Card are rewarded with ETH
        - Strategy Options:
            1. Higher APR:
                ‚Ä¢ Uses highest value Entropic Card
                ‚Ä¢ More specialized and inconsistent data utilization
                ‚Ä¢ Highest potential APR
                ‚Ä¢ Network parts used inconsistently
            2. Lower APR:
                ‚Ä¢ Uses most common Entropic Card
                ‚Ä¢ More frequent data utilization
                ‚Ä¢ Cover high volume parts of LIFT network
        - Each function varies in complexity, network value and breadth of utility
        - Displays % of other operators currently using that strategy
        - Cards obtainable through:
            ‚Ä¢ ETH purchase
            ‚Ä¢ Data Block rewards
            ‚Ä¢ Referring friends
        üíé Rewards Structure:
        - AI Machine Activation:
            ‚Ä¢ Requires 0.005 ETH deposit
            ‚Ä¢ ETH withdrawable by burning AI Machine
        - Continuous Rewards:
            ‚Ä¢ DataGold (dGOLD) points earned continuously regardless of strategy
        - Epoch Rewards:
            ‚Ä¢ Occur every 12 hours
